Repository for the python files associated with Casey Fecko's Iris Dataset project
ClassifierComparison.py 
  Code to implement 5 methods for classifiers from Scikit Learn, and test their accuracy for the Iris Dataset  using samples of the code.
  
FourFeatureTest.py
  Prints the confusion matrix, classification report, and shows the confusion matrix plot for the full Iris Dataset using the Naive Bayes Classifier

ThreeFeatureTest.py
  Prints the confusion matrix, classification report, and shows the confusion matrix plot for the Iris Dataset with one feature removed each time, 4 matrices, 4 reports, and 4 plots.
  
TwoFeatureTest.py
  Prints the confusion matrix, classification report, and shows the confusion matrix plot for the Iris Dataset for each of three possible combinations of the data with two features removed. 
  
SixPairPlots.py
  Shows the plots for each combination of two features in two-dimentional plots.
